# Avatars
This folder contains all avatar pictures, which were generated by ChatGPT. 

## `avatar_id.json`
The file `avatar_id.json` is used by components to load avatars. The database stores the avatar of a user as an integer, and that integer corresponds to an index in this json file. Therefore the json file should **NOT** be modified, as changing it would corrupt the avatar_id data in the database.
